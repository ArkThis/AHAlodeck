# This is supposed to be real.

As real as files and filenames and paths can be.
And I am here to proof it.
I am certain of that it's possible, and great to be made.

The idea of my AHAlodeck may present more than just a filesystem-with-benefits.
Something laying right in front of our eyes, and in production use - and simply it was time to orchestrate that into a new computing feeling.

Finally a data handling paradigm which makes "IT stuff" as we know it, not only easier, but intrinsically more intuitional, be design of the idea for meta+data=object+id, and play with that.

for real.

So here are my ❤️💜️💚️ for a good future.


If you see the red-heart slightly "misaligned", you're in.
Welcome.
