# This idea is supposed to become real.

As real as files and filenames and paths can be.
And I am here to proof it.
I am certain of that it's possible, and great to be made.

Why not?
It'd be great for everyone doing anything with computers, basically.

The idea of my AHAlodeck may present more than just a 'filesystem-with-benefits'.
Existing components laying right in front of our eyes, and are well in
production use. It simply was about time to orchestrate these parts into a new
computing feeling.

A good one.

Finally a data handling paradigm which makes "IT stuff" as we know it, not only
easier, but intrinsically more intuitional. By the very design of the idea for
meta+data=object+id.


For real.

So here are my ❤️💜️💚️ for a good future.

Welcome to AHAlodeck.
