Welcome! :)


# A Holodeck by August.

Here we're building a very simple, yet powerful environment that can digest "Meta+Data Objects" in clever ways.
Based on already existing FOSS components that we try to orchestrate to each other.

**And simply make use of "name=value" tags in the filesystem (where filename and path are stored); and using that filesystem directly as database.**


TL;DR:


> **If I'm correct, then I may introduce a change for anyone dealing with digital data, comparable to going beyond 8.3 uppercase-only ASCII characters in a filename (1995), to Object Oriented programming and responsive design: Using a common filesystem. üòÑÔ∏è**

It is incredibly simple and feels very useful already in early prototype components.

**Just imagine being able to "tag" (somekey=somevalue) any file and folder:  
Right-Click-Edit-Metadata.**


What I am suggesting is to use existing FOSS-licensed technologies designed for storing and managing modern (even big) data. And really letting go of files-in-folders with excel sheets and incompatible databases and embedded metadata to a data-design and handling, making use of proper Object Storage environment's capabilities.

Simply, putting metadata with the data: Where it belongs.
And draw relationships right with others of those same "Meta+Data Objects".
And support (de)referencing any kind of "link" information.

Even supporting torrent magnet URLs for options to have light-or-heavy Data Object manifestations.
On the fly. ;)



Welcome.
This is ongoing research-and-development.
